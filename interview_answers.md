# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

    A stateful component is a class, while a functional component is a function. 
    
    Stateful components have access to advanced lifecycle methods, such as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, and triggering events upon specific changes of state must be done inside control flow statements within an appropriate lifecycle method.

    Functional components have access to hooks, such as useState and useEffect, which can help us separate and reuse stateful logic between different components more easily than with class components.

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

3. Define stateful logic.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
